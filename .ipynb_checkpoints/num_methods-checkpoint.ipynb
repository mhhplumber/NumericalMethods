    "#Numerical Methods of Approximation for Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "For many equations, it may be difficult to integrate, some are even impossible to integrate by normal means. So how can we model, if roughly the behavior of the solution? In many applications where solutions are needed, a numerical approximation can be made use of to similar effect as the symbolic solution. Numerical approximations though inexact can be made use of on any ordinary differential equation.\n",
    "\tSome such methods include Eulerâ€™s method, Runge-Kutta methods and other Linear Multistep Methods.\n"
